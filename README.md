# Technical Constraints

- **No External Libraries:** Do not use Bootstrap, Tailwind, or external JS frameworks. Use vanilla CSS (Flexbox/Grid).
- **JavaScript:** If any interactivity is needed (like a mobile menu toggle), write the JavaScript strictly **inside a `<script>` tag at the bottom of the HTML file**. Do not create a separate .js file.

# Output Instructions
Please generate the full code for these two files below.

## File 1: index.html
- Should link to `style.css`.
- Should contain semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>).
- Should contain the embedded JS for the mobile menu or simple animations.

## File 2: style.css
- Should contain all styling, variables for colors, and media queries for responsiveness.
